:::note Flux

Flux = surface integral of a vector field

Relation to density, volumn and area:

## Understand transformation/surface integral

Break coordinates into one dimensions and think it as a combination of different linear equations.

### To compute the area of the parallelogram are determined by the transformation(vectors)

First, think about how to get the length of vector a;

If we describe the distance between (t_A, s_A), and (t_B, s_B) as being dt, how to express a good approximation of vector a?

Then, think about how to compute the length of vector b in the same way.

Finally, combine them, or integrating everything together.

### Summary

Generalizing everything we did in the previous example, the surface area of our parametric surface S is expressed using the integral:
