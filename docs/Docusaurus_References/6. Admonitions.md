# Use Admonitions

In addition to the basic Markdown syntax, we use [remark-admonitions](https://github.com/elviswolcott/remark-admonitions) alongside MDX to add support for admonitions. Admonitions are wrapped by a set of 3 colons.

Example:

:::note

The content and title \*can\* include markdown.

:::

:::tip You can specify an optional title

Heads up! Here's a pro-tip.

:::

:::info

Useful information.

:::

:::caution

Warning! You better pay attention!

:::

:::danger

Danger danger, mayday!

:::
